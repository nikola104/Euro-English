Euro English Converter

This project is a simple Java program that converts standard English text into Euro English.
Euro English is a variety of English that is spoken in countries within the European Union, and has its own unique vocabulary and grammar rules.

What I Learned
During the development of this project, I learned several key skills, including:

- String manipulation in Java
- Regular expressions and pattern matching
- Debugging and troubleshooting code

How It Works
The program takes a standard English text as input, and applies a series of rules to convert it to Euro English.

These rules include:

- Replacing "ci" with "si"
- Replacing "ce" with "se"
- Replacing "ck" with "k"
- Replacing "ee" with "i"
- Replacing "oo" with "u"
- Removing duplicate letters
- Removing the letter "e" from the end of words in certain case

The resulting output is a Euro English version of the input text.

Usage
To use the program, simply run the Main class in a Java environment, and input the standard English text when prompted. The program will then output the Euro English version of the text.
